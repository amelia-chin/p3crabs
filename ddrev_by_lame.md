- We really like how you linked your APIs and provided a topic for your project.
- We liked how you included how each component would play in your project specifically, but it would also be good to include a more general summary of what role each component plays.
- Very detailed site map and component map, but I would also add a more general component map.
- In your site map, you only make an API request to get a trivia question, how are you using your other two APIs?
- The timeline is very clear (have you started working on it already?)
- In general, this design doc is very strong! Great work!
